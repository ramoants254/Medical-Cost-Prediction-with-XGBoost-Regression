# Medical-Cost-Prediction-with-XGBoost-Regression
Today marks the second day of my 60-day journey to create machine learning projects. I focused on predicting medical costs using the insurance.csv dataset from Kaggle website
I started with data preprocessing, ensuring the dataset was clean and ready for analysis. I then created a correlation matrix to understand the relationships between variables. After careful consideration, I selected XGBoost Regression as the model due to its efficiency and performance with tabular data.

I trained the model, evaluated its performance, and made predictions on unseen data. This project showcases my steps in data preprocessing, feature selection, model selection, and evaluation. Follow along as I continue to build and refine my machine learning skills! ðŸ˜Š
